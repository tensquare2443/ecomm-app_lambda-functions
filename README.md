# Lambda Functions for Ecommerce Application/CMS  

This repository contains the six lambda functions used in my ecommerce content management system app (https://github.com/tensquare2443/ecomm-1).  

These six lambda functions interact with two total DynamoDB databases. One DB is for users (sign-in, authorization), and the other for products (get one, get many, delete one, create one).
